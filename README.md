```

## ðŸ§ª Submitting Tests

QA Engineers, responsible for ensuring the quality and functionality of the API, should follow test automation best practices including:

#### Page Object Pattern
- Implement Page Object Model (POM) to create an object repository for web UI elements
- Each page should have its corresponding page class
- Maintain separation between test methods and page specific code
- Group related elements and actions within relevant page objects

#### Data-Driven Testing
- Externalize test data in JSON/YAML files
- Parameterize tests to run with multiple data sets
- Maintain test data separate from test logic
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios

#### Test scenarios that need to be implemented
- Implement test cases for user registration, login, and logout
- Test user roles and permissions (Admin, Agent, User)
- Verify user profile management functionality
- Test property listing and search functionality
- Validate property details and booking process
- Verify user notifications and alerts


#### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% test coverage for critical paths
- Test all user roles (Admin, Agent, User)

#### Technical Stack
- Test Automation Frameworks:
    - Choose one of the following:
        - Selenium WebDriver (Java/Python/JavaScript)
        - WebDriver.IO (JavaScript/TypeScript)
        - Cypress (JavaScript/TypeScript)
        - Playwright (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Continuous Integration:
    - GitHub Actions for automated test execution
    - Parallel test execution
    - Scheduled test runs
- Test Reporting:
    - Allure Reports integration
    - Detailed test execution results
    - Screenshots and video captures
